    "I tried to manually tune it but I was not very lucky and I received many low scores, so I looked at the helper functions in `util.py` and found Counter, which can be essentially used as a vector, and its `__mul__` method can be used as dot product. Then I manually calculated a list of features, most of which are pretty standard (can be directed acquired from `GameState` class):\n",

    "Then, I then generated 2000 sample runs basically just by randomly generate the weights and record the scores (print to file), and ran a linear regression on it. The problem with this approach is that I don't really know how to interpret the coefficient, since they are one side of the equation - I need to know how to boost Y, which is the score, but I don't have any control over X, and I don't even know the distribution of X in each game. However, at least they provided me some guidelines for later manual tuning. I simply record the learned coefficient and the weights that generate the max score I've seen, and started manual tuning.\n",
